## What is the difference between merge and rebase?
- Both commits D and E are still here, but we create merge commit M that inherits changes from both D and E. However, this creates diamond shape, which many people find very confusing.
- We create commit R, which actual file content is identical to that of merge commit M above. But, we get rid of commit E, like it never existed (denoted by dots - vanishing line). Because of this obliteration, E should be local to developer Ed and should have never been pushed to any other repository.
