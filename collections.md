## What is the complexity for get in Hashmap?
It depends on many things. It's usually O(1), with a decent hash which itself is constant time... but you could have a hash which takes a long time to compute, and if there are multiple items in the hash map which return the same hash code, get will have to iterate over them calling equals on each of them to find a match.

## What is the complexity for get in Hashmap for keys with hashcode = 1?
If there are multiple items in the hash map which return the same hash code, get will have to iterate over them calling equals on each of them to find a match, so it's O(n) in this case.

## What is the hierarchy of collections?
The collection interfaces are divided into two groups. The most basic interface, java.util.Collection, has the following descendants:
+ java.util.Set
+ java.util.SortedSet
+ java.util.NavigableSet
+ java.util.Queue
+ java.util.concurrent.BlockingQueue
+ java.util.concurrent.TransferQueue
+ java.util.Deque
+ java.util.concurrent.BlockingDeque

The other collection interfaces are based on java.util.Map and are not true collections. However, these interfaces contain collection-view operations, which enable them to be manipulated as collections. Map has the following offspring:
+ java.util.SortedMap
+ java.util.NavigableMap
+ java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentMap
+ java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentNavigableMap

## What is the difference between LinkedList and ArrayList?
From the hierarchy diagram, they all implement List interface. They are very similar to use. Their main difference is their implementation which causes different performance for different operations.  ArrayList is implemented as a resizable array. As more elements are added to ArrayList, its size is increased dynamically. It's elements can be accessed directly by using the get and set methods, since ArrayList is essentially an array. LinkedList is implemented as a double linked list. Its performance on add and remove is better than Arraylist, but worse on get and set methods.

## What is better to use LinkedList or ArrayList?
The difference of their performance is obvious. LinkedList is faster in add and remove, but slower in get. Based on the complexity table and testing results, we can figure out when to use ArrayList or LinkedList. In brief, LinkedList should be preferred if: 
+ there are no large number of random access of element
+ there are a large number of add/remove operations

## What is the implementation of HashMap?
***HashMap*** uses the array of Nodes(named as table), where Node has fields like the key, value (and much more). Here the Node is represented by class HashMapEntry. Basically, HashMap has an array where the key-value data is stored. It calculates the index in the array where the Node can be placed and it is placed there. Now while getting the element from HashMap, it again calculates the index of the element to retrieve and goes to the array index and returns the value of the element/Node(if exists).

## What are the implementations of Map?
The Java platform contains three general-purpose Map implementations: ***HashMap***, ***TreeMap***, and ***LinkedHashMap***. Their behavior and performance are precisely analogous to HashSet, TreeSet, and LinkedHashSet

## What is the complexity of removing the last element from LinkedList?

## What are the differences between Set and Map?
Main differences between a ***Set*** and a ***Map*** in Java are:
+ Duplicate Elements: A Set does not allow inserting duplicate elements. A Map does not allow using duplicate keys, but it allows inserting duplicate values for unique keys.
+ Null values: A Set allows inserting maximum one null value. In a Map we can have single null key at most and any number of null values.
+ Ordering: A Set does not maintain any order of elements. Some of sub-classes of a Set can sort the elements in an order like LinkedHashSet. A Map does not maintain any order of its elements. Some of its sub-classes like TreeMap store elements of the map in ascending order of keys.

## What are the possible implementations of Map for concurrency?
+ ***ConcurrentHashMap*** allows concurrent modification of the Map from several threads without the need to block them. Collections.synchronizedMap(map) creates a blocking Map which will degrade performance, albeit ensure consistency (if used properly).
+ ***Collections.synchronizedMap(Map)*** is the second option if you need to ensure data consistency, and each thread needs to have an up-to-date view of the map. Use the first if performance is critical, and each thread only inserts data to the map, with reads happening less frequently.

## What is the main difference between Stream API and Collection?
Streams differ from collections in several ways:
+ No storage. A stream is not a data structure that stores elements; instead, it conveys elements from a source such as a data structure, an array, a generator function, or an I/O channel, through a pipeline of computational operations.
+ Functional in nature. An operation on a stream produces a result, but does not modify its source. For example, filtering a Stream obtained from a collection produces a new Stream without the filtered elements, rather than removing elements from the source collection.
+ Laziness-seeking. Many stream operations, such as filtering, mapping, or duplicate removal, can be implemented lazily, exposing opportunities for optimization. For example, "find the first  String with three consecutive vowels" need not examine all the input strings. Stream operations are divided into intermediate (Stream-producing) operations and terminal (value- or side-effect-producing) operations. Intermediate operations are always lazy.
+ Possibly unbounded. While collections have a finite size, streams need not. Short-circuiting operations such as limit(n) or findFirst() can allow computations on infinite streams to complete in finite time.
+ Consumable. The elements of a stream are only visited once during the life of a stream. Like an Iterator, a new stream must be generated to revisit the same elements of the source.

## What should be avoided in parallel stream?
The problem is that all parallel streams use common fork-join thread pool, and if you submit a long-running task, you effectively block all threads in the pool. Consequently, you block all other tasks that are using parallel streams.

## What is forEach?

## When is it better to use foreach loop instead of Iterable.forEach()?
The deficiencies of Iterable.forEach():
- Can't use non-final variables;
- Can't handle checked exceptions;
- Limited flow-control;
- Might execute in parallel;
- Might hurt performance;
- If you do need parallelism, it is probably much faster and not much more difficult to use an ExecutorService;
- Makes debugging more confusing;
- Streams in general are more difficult to code, read, and debug;
