## What is having in sql?
+ HAVING filters records that work on summarized GROUP BY results.
+ HAVING applies to summarized group records, whereas WHERE applies to individual records.
+ Only the groups that meet the HAVING criteria will be returned.
+ HAVING requires that a GROUP BY clause is present.
+ WHERE and HAVING can be in the same query.

## What are the possible issues with indexes?
Although indexes are intended to enhance a database's performance, there are times when they should be avoided.
+ The following guidelines indicate when the use of an index should be reconsidered.
+ Indexes should not be used on small tables.
+ Tables that have frequent, large batch updates or insert operations.
+ Indexes should not be used on columns that contain a high number of NULL values.
+ Columns that are frequently manipulated should not be indexed.
